# What is props in React?
In React, props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only, meaning a child component cannot modify the data received from the parent.Props help make components reusable and dynamic.


ðŸ“Œ Ways to Pass Data Between Components in React
There are two main ways to pass data:

Direction	                Method	                                               How It Works
Parent â†’ Child	         Using Props                                           Parent sends data via props to Child.
Child â†’ Parent	Using a Callback Function (Props as a Function)	     Parent passes a function as a prop. Child calls it to send data back.
